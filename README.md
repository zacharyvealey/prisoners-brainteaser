# prisoners-brainteaser
A program to estimate how long it would take to escape according to the brainteaser below.

The following brainteaser was obtained from https://www.braingle.com/brainteasers/18012/prisoners-and-2-switches-scenario-a.html where I recommend trying to solve it yourself before looking at the solution also posted in the link. To determine the length it will take the prisoners to escape it is assumed that one prisoner at random visits the cell each day.

"The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, "You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another. 

In the prison there is a switch room which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. BOTH SWITCHES ARE IN THEIR OFF POSITIONS NOW. The switches are not connected to anything. 

After today, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.

No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.

But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else. At any time any one of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.' 

If it is true, then you will all be set free. If it is false, and somebody has not yet visited the switch room, you will be fed to the alligators." 

In the program contained in the repository you can choose how many trials you would like to run (as well as number of prisoners) to simulate their escape. The results for each trial are shown along with the averaged results.
